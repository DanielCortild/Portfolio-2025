Hi, I'm Daniel!

I am currently a MSc student in Applied Mathematics at the [University of Groningen](https://www.rug.nl/), member of
the [Systems, Control and Optimization group](https://www.rug.nl/research/bernoulli/groups/sco) under the supervision of
Juan Peypouquet, graduating in June 2025. I currently focus on stochastic gradient methods and their convergence
properties. Previously, I obtained a BSc in Mathematics from the [University of Groningen](https://www.rug.nl/), where I
specialised in Numerical Analysis.

**Research Interests:** Convex Optimization, Global Optimization, Fixed-Point Iterations, Computer-Aided Proofs
