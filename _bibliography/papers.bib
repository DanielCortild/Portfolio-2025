  title={{Krasnoselskii--Mann Iterations: Inertia, Perturbations and Approximation}},
  abstract={This paper is concerned with the study of a family of fixed point iterations combining relaxation with different inertial (acceleration) principles. We provide a systematic, unified and insightful analysis of the hypotheses that ensure their weak, strong and linear convergence, either matching or improving previous results obtained by analysing particular cases separately. We also show that these methods are robust with respect to different kinds of perturbations–which may come from computational errors, intentional deviations, as well as regularisation or approximation schemes–under surprisingly weak assumptions. Although we mostly focus on theoretical aspects, numerical illustrations in image inpainting and electricity production markets reveal possible trends in the behaviour of these types of methods.},

  title={{Global Optimization Algorithm through High-Resolution Sampling}},
  abstract={We present an optimization algorithm that can identify a global minimum of a potentially nonconvex smooth function with high probability, assuming the Gibbs measure of the potential satisfies a logarithmic Sobolev inequality. Our contribution is twofold: on the one hand we propose a global optimization method, which is built on an oracle sampling algorithm producing arbitrarily accurate samples from a given Gibbs measure. On the other hand, we propose a new sampling algorithm, drawing inspiration from both overdamped and underdamped Langevin dynamics, as well as from the high-resolution differential equation known for its acceleration in deterministic settings. While the focus of the paper is primarily theoretical, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms on the Rastrigin function, where it outperforms recent approaches.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
